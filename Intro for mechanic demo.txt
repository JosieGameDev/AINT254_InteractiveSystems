HI!
Aim of the game is to keep the letuce (big green circle in middle) safe from the oncoming tortoise (cubes) as long as possible
Move player with WASD
Click on tortoise when close enough to flip them over - will pause them until another one saves them
Right click on a spot to spawn in decoy food to distract tortoise

In full game the game will end when lettuce is destroyed

THANKS
