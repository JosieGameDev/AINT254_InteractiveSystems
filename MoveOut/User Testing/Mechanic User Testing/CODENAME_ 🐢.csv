"Timestamp","How does the flipping mechanic feel? (eg natural, overpowered, clunky)","How does the decoy food mechanic feel?","How long do you think a level should last?","How would you suggest scores are calculated?","Camera Angle: how would you suggest the camera is positioned in the scene?","Currently the player has to be within range of tortoise to flip it or do any other actions. Should I stick with this or try a god type game so there's no player character on screen, player can click anywhere to trigger effects","Any other player ideas? Current actions to deter tortoise are flipping them, digging holes for them to fall into, throwing decoy food, creating a slippy surface, and a catapult. Any other ideas for comical non-violent ways to slow them down would be greatly appreciated ","Any other comments on the base mechanic would be ace "
"2019/10/17 2:12:16 PM GMT+1","Somewhat overpowered","Good but lasts a bit too long","30 seconds to 1 minute","Player must last as long as possible, timer counts up rather than down, highest scores are the ones with the longest time alive before tortoise eat all of the lettuce","Top Down, zoomed out to see the whole field (as shown in the demo)","Stick with the current player character based design","Maybe have a helper AI spawn in and help you flip them over for a short time but you can only use it once per level.","Tweak the timings of how long they disable the tortoises seems too long."
"2019/10/17 2:18:25 PM GMT+1","feels a bit clunky and unclear I flipped a tortoise","It's a good idea and appears to be functioning perfectly (I'd suggest a timer to know how long left it has) ","15 to 30 seconds;30 seconds to 1 minute","Player must last as long as possible, timer counts up rather than down, highest scores are the ones with the longest time alive before tortoise eat all of the lettuce","Top Down, zoomed out to see the whole field (as shown in the demo)","Stick with the current player character based design","Building walls or slow moving traps to slow down the tortoise","The player seems to be able to be flipped itself due to its tall size, perhaps fixing it on a axis?"
"2019/10/17 2:28:06 PM GMT+1","It's very hard to tell if they are flipped. If they changed colour it would be easier to know.","If you place the decoy food where the player is, they will fly away.","30 seconds to 1 minute","Player must last as long as possible, timer counts up rather than down, highest scores are the ones with the longest time alive before tortoise eat all of the lettuce","Top Down, zoomed out to see the whole field (as shown in the demo)","Stick with the current player character based design","Potentially traps that mean they are stuck in their position for a certain amount of time before they leave.","Show a cooldown of time remaining until the player can place another decoy food. A stunned mechanic (such as stars rotating around them) could be good for the player to know when the tortoise is stunned and when it is walking around."
"2019/10/17 2:36:08 PM GMT+1","Could do with an indication on whether or not you're close enough to flip them over","A bit underpowered, the food disappeared really quickly when I used it. Maybe improve the life a little and show the player the cooldown :D","30 seconds to 1 minute","Gets a one to three star rating depending on how much of the lettuce's health is left at the end of the timer","Isometric style, so the player can clearly see when the turtles have been flipped","Stick with the current player character based design","No this seems like enough variety for mechanics :)","Nope, just want to know who the player is in this scenario. Is it a farmer trying to save his massive lettuce?"
"2019/10/17 2:41:25 PM GMT+1","Pretty natural, maybe overpowered to begin with but I can see it getting quickly not ","It feels really good","30 seconds to 1 minute","Player must last as long as possible, timer counts up rather than down, highest scores are the ones with the longest time alive before tortoise eat all of the lettuce","Top Down, zoomed out to see the whole field (as shown in the demo)","Change it to a god type game","Maybe a protection bubble over the lettuce as a pick up/power up?","This game is adorable, more adorable ideas please! "
"2019/10/17 2:46:49 PM GMT+1","More visual feedback for when a turtle can be flipped would be good. ","Maybe make it so pressing button drops the food instead of clickign somewhere.","1 minute plus","Gets a one to three star rating depending on how much of the lettuce's health is left at the end of the timer","Top Down, zoomed out to see the whole field (as shown in the demo)","Maybe make it so hitting into the turtle flips it instead of just clicking it.","A trap of sorts that could slow them down",""
"2019/10/17 2:51:53 PM GMT+1","Natural ","A bit rough","15 to 30 seconds","Must outlast timer without any tortoise reaching lettuce patch in order to pass that level","Top Down, zoomed out to see the whole field (as shown in the demo)","Change it to a god type game","Lightning strike to scare them away temporalily",""
"2019/10/17 3:00:10 PM GMT+1","I like the flipping mechanic, feels good and natural","nice idea, gives the player more of a chance","15 to 30 seconds","Gets a one to three star rating depending on how much of the lettuce's health is left at the end of the timer","Top Down, zoomed out to see the whole field (as shown in the demo)","Stick with the current player character based design","none",""
"2019/10/17 3:08:56 PM GMT+1","Clunky, I wasn't sure if I was doing anything.","Didn't seem too useful, they eat it immediately ","1 minute plus","Gets a one to three star rating depending on how much of the lettuce's health is left at the end of the timer","Top Down, zoomed out to see the whole field (as shown in the demo)","Stick with the current player character based design","Not sure, you've got a few ideas there to try out.","Fun little idea. Keep at it!"
"2019/10/17 3:15:29 PM GMT+1","I think it did feel a bit overpowered - with that being said, maybe it'd be less overpowered as the game went on? Perhaps a limit every X amount of seconds on how many turtles you can flip, or a turtle flipping animation from the player in order to delay them?","Neat! Perhaps there should be a limit, though, with pickups available as the level goes on.","30 seconds to 1 minute","I think the bottom two options in separate modes would be a cool idea.","Top Down, zoomed out to see the whole field (as shown in the demo)","Stick with the current player character based design","Perhaps the player could topple over obstacles in the environment, resulting in the turtles having to circumvent that obstacle, delaying them?","Cool idea! :)"
"2019/10/17 3:36:05 PM GMT+1","Clunky i would say unfortunately","I think its quite good. I think it might be broken as on tortoise spent ages trying to eat it others munch it really quick.","1 minute plus","Player must last as long as possible, timer counts up rather than down, highest scores are the ones with the longest time alive before tortoise eat all of the lettuce","Top Down, zoomed out to see the whole field (as shown in the demo);Top down, zoomed right in so only a small area of the map is visible, must keep moving to see whats happening","Stick with the current player character based design","Water gun, other mechanic like an early warning system. Install a ludicrously high tech radar system just to protect some cabbage.","I like it. Child friendly, fun and fast paced. Types of tortoise maybe faster ones, ones that take more to slow down, ones that can swim and attack from a place your normally protected from (a natural lake or pond)"
