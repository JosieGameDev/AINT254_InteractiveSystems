			HI!

				-Aim of the game is to keep the letuce safe from the oncoming tortoise until the timer runs out
				-Move player with WASD
				-Click on tortoise when close enough to flip them over - will pause them until another one saves them
				-Right click to do your secondary action; either a loud noise which stuns nearby tortoise, or dropping decoy carrot to distract them
				-Toggle between secondary actions with the Spacebar

			The levels will have more actions available and more tortoise to ward off as difficulty increases
			Particle effects are meant to simulate food being eaten 

			THANKS
